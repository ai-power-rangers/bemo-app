# CV-First Checkpoint Implementation Tracker - Phase 1 (First 1/4)

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGY: Building TangramCV as Parallel Implementation

**Decision:** Creating `TangramCV` as a completely separate game alongside the original `Tangram` game. This allows:
- Zero risk to existing game
- Side-by-side testing and comparison
- Clean architecture without legacy constraints
- Easy rollback if needed
- Original serves as reference implementation

**Migration Plan:**
1. Build TangramCV with full CV-ready features
2. Test thoroughly against original
3. Replace TangramGame registration with TangramCVGame
4. Rename TangramCV â†’ Tangram after validation
5. Archive original code

## Overview
Implementing lines 1-450 of CV-first-checkpoint.md, focusing on three-zone layout, dynamic anchor system, and beginning CV output generation.

- [ ] **CVToInternalConverter.swift (Partial)**
  - [ ] Create in TangramCV/Services/
  - [ ] Implement CV name mapping
  - [ ] Setup camera inversion toggle
  - [ ] Begin coordinate conversion logic

#### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] **TangramCVGameView.swift**
  - [ ] Create main game view
  - [ ] Integrate TangramThreeZoneScene
  
- [ ] **TangramCVGameViewModel.swift**
  - [ ] Create view model with CV stream processing
  - [ ] Add anchor tracking
  - [ ] No snap behavior

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
1. **Parallel implementation** - TangramCV alongside original Tangram
2. **Full migration** - No feature flags within TangramCV
3. **Haptic feedback** - UIImpactFeedbackGenerator for zone entry
4. **Anchor indicator** - Small green circle at piece center
5. **No snapping** - Pieces stay exactly where dropped
6. **Proper MVVM-S** - Services handle logic, views handle display

### Coordinate System Contract
- Internal: Y-up, radians, normalized (square = 1.0)
- CV Output: Y-up, degrees, relative to anchor
- SpriteKit: Y-down conversion at render only

### Performance Optimizations
- CV stream throttled to 20Hz (50ms minimum between updates)
- Validation at 10Hz when implemented
- No physics simulation - direct manipulation

## Shared Components (Reused from Original)
- `TangramPieceType` - Piece definitions
- `TangramGameGeometry` - Vertex calculations
- `TangramColors` - Color schemes
- `GamePuzzleData` - Puzzle data structures
- `TangramGameConstants` - Constants (will override some)

- [ ] No snapping behavior anywhere
- [ ] CV output logged to console

### Performance Testing

## Current Implementation Summary

### What's Working Now âœ…
1. **TangramCV Game** - Fully parallel implementation alongside original
2. **Three-Zone Layout** - Reference (top), Assembly (middle), Storage (bottom)
3. **Dynamic Anchor System** - First piece becomes anchor, promotes on removal
4. **CV Output Stream** - Generates CV JSON at 20Hz with relative positions
5. **Haptic Feedback** - Triggers when entering assembly zone
6. **No Snapping** - Pieces stay exactly where dropped
7. **Visual Indicators** - Green dot for anchor, dashed boundary for assembly

### Ready for Testing ðŸ§ª
The game should now be playable! You can:
1. Build and run the app
2. Select "Tangram CV" from the lobby (green camera icon)
3. Pick a puzzle
4. Drag pieces from storage to assembly zone
5. Watch the CV output indicator in top-right
6. Feel haptic feedback when entering assembly
7. See anchor indicator (green dot) on first placed piece

### What's Missing (Phase 2) ðŸ“‹
1. **Relative Validation** - Still needs TangramRelativeValidator
2. **CV Input Processing** - CVToInternalConverter for real CV data
3. **Completion Detection** - Currently placeholder
4. **Puzzle Loading** - May need adjustment for actual puzzle data

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Build and test the visual layout
2. âœ… Verify three zones display correctly
3. âœ… Test piece dragging and haptic feedback
4. âœ… Confirm anchor system works
5. âœ… Check CV output in console
6. Begin Phase 2: Relative validation implementation
