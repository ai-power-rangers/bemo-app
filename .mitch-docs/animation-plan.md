I’m going to quickly open the Tangram SpriteKit rendering pipeline and core math/models to understand how pieces are represented, laid out, and animated. Then I’ll propose the animation sandbox plan and integration points.

I reviewed how pieces, geometry, and SpriteKit are wired today, including `TangramPuzzleScene`, `PuzzlePieceNode`, `TangramGameGeometry`, `TangramPoseMapper`, `TangramRotationValidator`, and existing effects/hints. You already use SKAction-based pulses, rotations, glamor particles, and a container `puzzleContainer` node for silhouettes, plus a bottom section with actual `PuzzlePieceNode`s. This is a good foundation for adding a standalone animation lab.

### Are these animations feasible and will they look good?
- **Yes.** All requested effects map cleanly to SpriteKit + SKAction + SKEmitterNode:
  - **Square Takeover:** grid of colored `SKShapeNode` squares flying/rotating in with staggered timings.
  - **Assemble:** cloned tangram pieces animating position + rotation into final pose with overshoot/settle.
  - **Explosion:** radial dispersal, spin, fade/scale with a timed dust emitter.
  - **Dust Cloud:** one `SKEmitterNode` preset; tuned lifetime/birthrate/textures.
  - **Breathing/Pulse/Wobble/Happy Jump/Shimmer:** reusable `SKAction` builders applied to any `SKNode` container.
- These are generic, require no per-puzzle hand-authoring, and can be applied to any assembled tangram container.

### Suggestions to improve polish without per-puzzle effort
- **Overshoot and settle curves**: small overshoot on assemble and wobble easing improves “life.”
- **Squash-and-stretch**: apply opposing scaleX/scaleY pairs on landing for “Happy Jump.”
- **Shadow ellipse**: an under-node `SKShapeNode` that scales/fades with vertical motion.
- **Shimmer sweep**: add a thin moving white gradient bar as a child node or short-lived `SKEmitterNode` sparkles instead of recoloring fills.
- **Staggered timings**: use small randomized `wait` before actions for organic feel.
- **Action keys**: always attach `.run(action, withKey:)` and `.removeAction(forKey:)` to avoid overlapping loops.

### Where to build it: new DevTool sandbox
Create a dedicated dev tool to keep experiments separate from the Tangram game, using the existing `DevTool` system.

- Folder: `Bemo/Features/DevTools/AnimationLab/`
  - `AnimationLabTool.swift` (conforms to `DevTool`)
  - `AnimationLabView.swift` (SwiftUI view with controls over a `SpriteView`)
  - `AnimationLabScene.swift` (`SKScene` testbed)
  - `Animations/TransitionAnimations.swift` (assemble, explosion, square takeover, dust)
  - `Animations/CharacterAnimations.swift` (breathing, pulse, wobble, happy jump, shimmer)
  - `Nodes/TangramCharacterNode.swift` (builds assembled tangram container from piece types)
  - `Controls/AnimationControlPanel.swift` (SwiftUI buttons/sliders to trigger/tune)
- Particles: `Bemo/Resources/Particles/`
  - `DustCloud.sks`
  - Optionally `Sparkle.sks`, `ShimmerTrail.sks`

### Reuse from current Tangram code
- Use `TangramGameGeometry` to draw piece shapes.
- Use `TangramPieceType` for piece set.
- For assembled node, mirror the silhouette construction used in `TangramPuzzleScene` but as a single container placed center-stage.
- For final integration later, you can animate the existing `targetSection`’s `puzzleContainer` or a cloned assembled container.

### API design (reusable, puzzle-agnostic)
- Transition animations (return actions so callers can compose):
  - `TransitionAnimations.makeSquareTakeover(in scene: SKScene, duration: TimeInterval) -> SKAction`
  - `TransitionAnimations.makeAssemble(pieces: [SKNode], targets: [(pos: CGPoint, rot: CGFloat)], duration: TimeInterval) -> [SKAction]`
  - `TransitionAnimations.makeExplosion(from node: SKNode, radius: CGFloat, spin: CGFloat, fadeOut: Bool, duration: TimeInterval) -> SKAction`
  - `TransitionAnimations.emitDust(at: CGPoint, in scene: SKScene, preset: String = "DustCloud")`
- Character animations (apply to a container `SKNode`):
  - `CharacterAnimations.breathing(amplitude: CGFloat = 0.04, period: TimeInterval = 2.0) -> SKAction`
  - `CharacterAnimations.pulse(strength: CGFloat = 0.08, count: Int = 2, duration: TimeInterval = 0.6) -> SKAction`
  - `CharacterAnimations.wobble(angle: CGFloat = .pi/32, period: TimeInterval = 0.8) -> SKAction`
  - `CharacterAnimations.happyJump(height: CGFloat = 24, duration: TimeInterval = 0.5, squash: CGFloat = 0.12) -> SKAction`
  - `CharacterAnimations.shimmer(duration: TimeInterval = 0.6) -> SKAction` (uses color brighten or emitter sweep across children)
- Helper:
  - `TangramCharacterNode.make(for pieceTypes: [TangramPieceType], transform: CGAffineTransform?) -> SKNode`
  - `TangramCharacterNode.makeFrom(targets: [GamePuzzleData.TargetPiece]) -> SKNode` (optional)

### Control panel (for fast iteration)
- Buttons: Square Takeover, Assemble, Explosion+Dust, Clear.
- Toggles: Loop breathing/wobble/shimmer, intensity sliders.
- “Swap character” picker: choose between animal/object/shapes puzzle templates or piece sets.
- “Randomize palette” for square takeover colors.

### Implementation plan (precise and sequential)
- Phase 1: Scaffold DevTool
  - Implement `AnimationLabTool` to return `AnimationLabView`.
  - `AnimationLabView` hosts `AnimationLabScene` in `SpriteView` and overlays `AnimationControlPanel`.
  - Build `TangramCharacterNode.make(...)` using `TangramGameGeometry` to generate `SKShapeNode` children centered at origin. Place into scene center.
  - Implement basic breathing/pulse/wobble applying to the top-level container using `.run(action, withKey:)`.
- Phase 2: Transitional animations
  - Square Takeover: create an overlay layer; spawn colored squares from off-screen or random positions, animate into a grid covering the viewport; fade overlay away.
  - Assemble: clone `TangramCharacterNode`’s children into off-stage positions with randomized rotation, then `group` move+rotate+ease curves to final pose with light overshoot and settle; end by replacing clones with the real assembled container.
  - Explosion: take children of the assembled container, compute direction from centroid, `sequence` spin+move+fade/scale; optionally scale container down at end; emit `DustCloud` at centroid timed to hide the pop.
  - Dust Cloud: create `DustCloud.sks` with broad initial burst and quick falloff.
- Phase 3: Character library polish
  - Happy Jump with squash-and-stretch and shadow ellipse changing scale/alpha.
  - Shimmer using either:
    - transient lighten on `fillColor` for each `SKShapeNode` child, or
    - a narrow emitter sweep that travels across the node’s bounding box.
  - Make everything parameterized, reusable, and composable.
- Phase 4: Hook points for future integration
  - Provide a small adapter that, given `TangramPuzzleScene`, can:
    - Extract/clone silhouettes under `targetSection`’s `puzzleContainer` into a new `assembledNode`.
    - Run `CharacterAnimations` on `assembledNode` after `showPuzzleCompleteCelebration()`, or replace `showPuzzleCompleteCelebration()` with transition + character animation sequence.
  - Keep this adapter optional and out of the game until the team is ready.

### Performance and quality notes
- Use `withKey:` on loops (e.g., "breathing", "wobble") and always `removeAction(forKey:)` before applying new loops.
- Prefer animating the parent container over many children when possible.
- Keep emitters short-lived; remove after sequences; cap `numParticlesToEmit`.
- Avoid heavy color animations every frame; prefer short pulses or emitter-based shimmer.

### Acceptance criteria
- DevTool runs standalone via `DevToolHostView` and lets designers trigger each effect.
- All five character animations loop cleanly on any assembled node.
- Transitional animations are parameterized and do not depend on concrete puzzle data.
- Dust cloud masks the swap from assembled tangram → animated “character” and back.
- No per-puzzle authoring required; works with any generated `TangramCharacterNode`.

### Integration outline (later)
- In `TangramPuzzleScene`, refactor `showPuzzleCompleteCelebration()` to:
  - add `assembledNode` (clone silhouettes or build from targets),
  - run `TransitionAnimations.makeExplosion(...)` + `emitDust(...)`,
  - then run `CharacterAnimations.breathing().forever()` or triggerable loops.
- Keep it behind a feature flag until final polish.

- Build time: 2–3 days to get all animations polished in the lab; 0.5–1 day to wire optional adapter to `TangramPuzzleScene`.

- **Yes**, these effects are realistic to implement, reusable, and will look great with modest effort.

- If you want, I can scaffold the `AnimationLab` DevTool with file stubs and the first two character animations next. 

- Changes made
  - Reviewed `TangramPuzzleScene`, `TangramSpriteView`, `PuzzlePieceNode`, `TangramGameGeometry`, `TangramPoseMapper`, `TangramRotationValidator`, and current effects/hints to verify geometry and SpriteKit setup and identify clean hook points.
- Plan impact
  - Adds a self-contained `AnimationLab` under `Features/DevTools` with reusable `SKAction` builders and emitters.
  - Zero risk to the current game; later integration is a small adapter calling the shared library from `TangramPuzzleScene`.
