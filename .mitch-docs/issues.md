# Tangram Editor Test Failures - Issue Analysis

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. GeometryEngine Issues (Highest Priority)

#### 1.1 `polygonsOverlap()` Method
- **Issue**: Doesn't handle coincident/identical polygons
- **Test Failure**: `testAreaOverlapDetection()` - Identical pieces at same position not detected as overlapping
- **Impact**: Core validation logic broken for overlap detection

#### 1.2 `sharedEdges()` Method  
- **Issue**: Only detects complete edge sharing, not partial overlaps
- **Test Failure**: `testEdgeContactDetection()` - Partial edge contact not detected
- **Impact**: Cannot detect when smaller edges slide along larger edges

#### 1.3 `sharedVertices()` Method
- **Issue**: Only checks vertex-to-vertex, not vertex-on-edge contacts
- **Test Failure**: `testVertexContactDetection()` - Triangle vertex touching square edge not detected
- **Impact**: Missing valid connection points

#### 1.4 `edgePartiallyCoincides()` Method
- **Issue**: Likely missing or incorrectly implemented
- **Test Failure**: `testPartialEdgeConnectionSatisfaction()` - Small edge on large edge not satisfied
- **Impact**: Edge-to-edge connections with different lengths don't work

### 2. ConstraintManager Issues (High Priority)

#### 2.1 `rotateAroundPoint()` Method
- **Issue**: Incorrect matrix multiplication/transformation order
- **Test Failure**: `testRotateAroundPoint()` - Point at (6,5) rotated 90Â° around (5,5) gives (-15,y) instead of (5,6)
- **Impact**: Rotation constraints completely broken

#### 2.2 `applyTranslationConstraint()` Method
- **Issue**: Uses absolute value instead of proper range clamping
- **Test Failure**: `testTranslationConstraintClamping()` - Negative translation (-5,0) returns 5 instead of clamping to 0
- **Impact**: Translation constraints don't respect minimum bounds

#### 2.3 `applyConstraints()` Method
- **Issue**: Constraints not being chained/accumulated properly
- **Test Failure**: `testApplyMultipleConstraints()` - Transform remains identity after applying constraints
- **Impact**: Multiple constraints on same piece don't work

### 3. TangramEditorViewModel Issues (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 `removePiece()` Method
- **Issue**: Doesn't properly remove all connections involving the removed piece
- **Test Failure**: `testRemovePiece()` - Connection count is 1 instead of 0 after piece removal
- **Impact**: Orphaned connections remain after piece deletion

#### 3.2 `rotatePieceAroundVertex()` Method
- **Issue**: Cascading failure from ConstraintManager's broken rotation
- **Test Failure**: `testRotatePieceAroundVertex()` - Rotation vertex doesn't remain fixed
- **Impact**: Vertex-constrained rotations don't work

### 4. Test Expectation Issues (Low Priority)

#### 4.1 Category Capitalization
- **Issue**: Test expects lowercase "animals" but gets "Animals"
- **Test Failure**: `testExportForGameplay()` - Category string mismatch
- **Impact**: Minor test assertion issue, not a functional problem
- **Fix**: Update test to expect capitalized category names

## Cascading Failures

Many ValidationService test failures are cascading from the GeometryEngine issues:
- `testInvalidAreaOverlapsInCollection()` 
- `testValidAssembly()`
- `testRotatedPieceValidation()`
- `testScaledPieceValidation()`

These will likely resolve once the core geometric detection is fixed.

## Fix Priority Order

1. **Fix GeometryEngine** geometric detection methods (blocks everything)
2. **Fix ConstraintManager** transformation methods (blocks constraints)
3. **Fix TangramEditorViewModel** connection cleanup
4. **Update test expectations** for category capitalization

## Root Cause Summary

The core issue is that the geometric foundation (GeometryEngine) has multiple unimplemented or incorrectly implemented methods. Since the entire Tangram Editor relies on accurate geometric calculations for:
- Detecting piece relationships (overlap, edge contact, vertex contact)
- Validating connections
- Applying constraints

These foundational bugs cascade through the entire system, causing most tests to fail.

## Next Steps

1. Review GeometryEngine implementation to understand current state
2. Implement missing geometric detection methods
3. Fix transformation math in ConstraintManager
4. Clean up connection removal logic
5. Re-run tests to verify fixes
