# Tangram Editor Implementation Status

## What's Complete ✅

### Core Business Logic (100% Complete)
1. **Geometric Engine** - All mathematical calculations for tangram pieces
   - Polygon overlap detection
   - Edge/vertex contact detection  
   - Transform operations (rotation, translation)
   - Bounding box calculations
   - Point-in-polygon tests

2. **Validation System** - Three-layer validation architecture
   - Layer 1: Pure geometric detection (overlaps, contacts)
   - Layer 2: Connection management (vertex-to-vertex, edge-to-edge)
   - Layer 3: Semantic validation (valid puzzle assembly)

3. **Connection System** - Constraint-based piece connections
   - Vertex-to-vertex connections (allows rotation around point)
   - Edge-to-edge connections (allows sliding along edge)
   - Support for different length edges (small edge slides on larger edge)
   - Full constraint satisfaction checking

4. **Data Models** - All required data structures
   - `TangramPuzzle` - Main puzzle with metadata
   - `TangramPiece` - Individual piece with transform
   - `Connection` - Connection between pieces with constraints
   - `PieceType` - All 7 tangram pieces defined
   - Categories and difficulty levels

5. **Services** 
   - `ConnectionService` - Creates and validates connections
   - `ValidationService` - Checks puzzle validity
   - `TangramEditorEngine` - Orchestrates state management

6. **Game Integration**
   - `TangramEditorGame` - Conforms to Game protocol
   - `TangramEditorViewModel` - View model with all business logic
   - Basic `TangramEditorView` - Placeholder UI ready for enhancement

7. **Tests** - All tests passing with correct naming

## Backend Implementation Status (100% Complete ✅)

All backend components have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ✅ Persistence Service (COMPLETED)
`PuzzlePersistenceService` implemented with:
- Save/load puzzles to Documents directory as JSON
- Automatic thumbnail generation on save
- Puzzle index management for fast listing
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Integration with ThumbnailGenerator

### 2. ✅ Connection Creation Logic (COMPLETED)
`TangramEditorViewModel` enhanced with complete connection workflow:
- State machine for connection creation (`ConnectionCreationState`)
- Point selection and compatibility checking
- Support for vertex-to-vertex and edge-to-edge connections
- Automatic constraint calculation based on connection type

## Frontend Developer Integration Guide

### Overview
The Tangram Editor backend is complete. All business logic, validation, and data models are ready. Your task is to build the UI that allows users to create tangram puzzles by placing and connecting pieces.

### Key Components You'll Work With

#### 1. TangramEditorViewModel (Your Main Interface)
Located at: `Bemo/Features/Game/Games/TangramEditor/ViewModels/TangramEditorViewModel.swift`

**Observable Properties (automatically tracked):**
```swift
// @Observable class - no property wrappers needed
var puzzle: TangramPuzzle        // Current puzzle being edited
var selectedPieceId: String?     // Currently selected piece
var anchorPieceId: String?       // Piece being connected from
var validationState: ValidationState  // Valid/Invalid with errors
var editMode: EditMode           // select/move/rotate/connect
var connectionState: ConnectionCreationState  // Connection workflow state
var highlightedPoints: [ConnectionPoint]      // Points to highlight
```

**Key Methods to Call:**
```swift
// Piece Management
func addPiece(type: PieceType, at: CGPoint)
func removePiece(id: String)
func updatePieceTransform(id: String, transform: CGAffineTransform)
func selectPiece(id: String?)

// Connection Management
func createConnection(type: ConnectionType)
func removeConnection(id: String)

// Validation (auto-called on changes)
func validate()

// Geometry Helpers
func getTransformedVertices(for: String) -> [CGPoint]?
func getPieceBounds(for: String) -> CGRect?
func getPieceCentroid(for: String) -> CGPoint?
```

#### 2. TangramEditorView (Starting Point)
Located at: `Bemo/Features/Game/Games/TangramEditor/Views/TangramEditorView.swift`

Currently a basic placeholder. You need to build:
- **Canvas area** for puzzle workspace
- **Piece palette** showing 7 tangram pieces
- **Properties panel** for puzzle metadata
- **Connection mode UI** for creating connections
- **Validation feedback** showing errors

### Core User Flow to Implement

#### Step 1: Create New Puzzle
1. User clicks "New Puzzle" 
2. Empty canvas appears
3. Piece palette shows 7 tangram pieces

#### Step 2: Place First Piece
1. User clicks piece from palette
2. Call `viewModel.addPiece(type: pieceType, at: centerPoint)`
3. Piece appears on canvas

#### Step 3: Place Second Piece
1. User clicks another piece from palette
2. Piece appears on canvas (not connected yet)

#### Step 4: Create Connection
1. User enters connection mode (`viewModel.editMode = .connect`)
2. User clicks first piece → highlight connection points:
   - Vertices (for vertex-to-vertex connections)
   - Edges (for edge-to-edge connections)
3. User selects a connection point
4. User clicks second piece → highlight compatible points
5. User selects matching point
6. Call `viewModel.createConnection(type: connectionType)`
7. Pieces snap together based on connection

#### Step 5: Adjust Within Constraints
- **Vertex-to-vertex**: Show rotation handle, allow rotation around shared vertex
- **Edge-to-edge**: Show slide handle, allow sliding along edge (if edges different length)

#### Step 6: Add More Pieces
- Repeat steps 2-5 for remaining pieces
- Each new piece must connect to existing assembly

#### Step 7: Save Puzzle
1. Validation must pass (`viewModel.validationState == .valid`)
2. Enter name, category, difficulty
3. Call save method (when persistence service ready)

### Visual Components Needed

#### 1. Piece Rendering
Use `PieceShape` to render tangram pieces:
```swift
struct PieceShape: Shape {
    let type: PieceType
    
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        let vertices = TangramGeometry.vertices(for: type)
        // Convert vertices to path
    }
}
```

#### 2. Connection Point Indicators
Show dots/highlights at:
- Vertices (corner points)
- Edge midpoints or endpoints

#### 3. Constraint Visualization
- **Rotation arc** for vertex connections
- **Sliding line** for edge connections
- **Lock icon** for fixed constraints

#### 4. Validation Feedback
```swift
switch viewModel.validationState {
case .valid:
    // Green checkmark
case .invalid(let errors):
    // Red X with error list
    // Common errors:
    // - "Pieces have area overlap"
    // - "Pieces touch without connection"  
    // - "Not all pieces connected"
}
```

### Piece Colors (Standard)
```swift
switch pieceType {
case .smallTriangle1, .smallTriangle2: return .blue
case .mediumTriangle: return .green
case .largeTriangle1, .largeTriangle2: return .red
case .square: return .yellow
case .parallelogram: return .purple
}
```

### Gesture Handling

#### Drag Gesture (Move Mode)
```swift
DragGesture()
    .onChanged { value in
        // Update piece position temporarily
    }
    .onEnded { value in
        let newTransform = // calculate transform
        viewModel.updatePieceTransform(id: pieceId, transform: newTransform)
    }
```

#### Rotation Gesture (Rotate Mode)
```swift
RotationGesture()
    .onChanged { angle in
        // Preview rotation
    }
    .onEnded { angle in
        // Apply rotation transform
    }
```

### Connection Creation UI Flow

1. **Select First Piece**
   - Highlight piece border
   - Show connection points (vertices and edges)

2. **Select Connection Point**
   - User taps vertex or edge
   - Store selection in view state

3. **Select Second Piece**
   - Highlight compatible connection points only
   - Vertices can connect to vertices
   - Edges can connect to edges (if parallel)

4. **Create Connection**
   ```swift
   let connectionType: ConnectionType = // based on selections
   viewModel.createConnection(type: connectionType)
   ```

5. **Pieces Snap Together**
   - Automatic transform calculation
   - Visual feedback for successful connection

### Testing Your UI

1. **Valid Puzzle Test**
   - Place all 7 pieces
   - Connect them properly
   - No overlaps, all connected
   - `validationState` should be `.valid`

2. **Invalid Cases to Handle**
   - Overlapping pieces → Show red overlap area
   - Touching without connection → Highlight contact point
   - Disconnected pieces → Show disconnected groups

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Small triangle sliding on large triangle edge
   - Multiple pieces connected to same piece
   - Rotation limits when constrained

### Precision Placement
- Free placement of pieces without grid constraints
- Natural snapping to connection points (vertices and edges)
- Constraint-based positioning through connections

### Don't Implement (Backend Will Handle)
- Persistence/saving (coming soon)
- Difficulty analysis
- Import/export
- Undo/redo

### Example Connection Types
```swift
// Vertex to vertex
ConnectionType.vertexToVertex(
    pieceA: "piece1-id",
    vertexA: 0,  // Index of vertex on piece1
    pieceB: "piece2-id", 
    vertexB: 2   // Index of vertex on piece2
)

// Edge to edge
ConnectionType.edgeToEdge(
    pieceA: "piece1-id",
    edgeA: 1,    // Index of edge on piece1
    pieceB: "piece2-id",
    edgeB: 0     // Index of edge on piece2
)
```

### Questions?
The backend team has implemented all business logic. Focus on making the UI intuitive for creating tangram puzzles. The validation system will guide users to create valid puzzles.
