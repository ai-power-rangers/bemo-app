## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Reused TangramEditor components extensively (models, geometry, services)
- Used implicitly unwrapped optional for puzzleSelectionViewModel to avoid @Observable issues
- Renamed views to avoid conflicts (TangramPuzzleCard vs PuzzleCardView)

### Technical Debt
- None currently

### Known Issues - FIXED
- ‚ùå PuzzleDifficulty has `.beginner` case we initially missed
- ‚ùå PuzzleDifficulty.rawValue is Int, not String (use .displayName)
- ‚ùå PuzzleCategory.rawValue already capitalized
- ‚ùå @Observable doesn't work with computed properties referencing other properties
- ‚ùå PuzzlePersistenceService.loadBundledPuzzles() is private (use loadAllPuzzles())
- ‚ùå loadThumbnail returns Data, not UIImage
- ‚ùå TangramPuzzle doesn't have isValid property

---

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING

### The Full Game Flow
1. **AppCoordinator** manages app state and navigation
2. **GameLobbyViewModel** creates game instances with SupabaseService injection
3. **Game selected** ‚Üí AppCoordinator navigates to `.game(selectedGame)`
4. **GameHostView** created with GameHostViewModel
5. **GameHostViewModel**:
   - Receives the Game instance
   - Implements GameDelegate for callbacks
   - Subscribes to CVService for piece recognition
   - Forwards CV pieces to game via `processRecognizedPieces()`
   - Manages session tracking with SupabaseService

### Existing Puzzle Infrastructure
- **SupabaseService** has `TangramPuzzleDTO` for cloud storage
- **PuzzlePersistenceService** handles local caching and Supabase sync
- Puzzles are fetched from Supabase and cached locally
- The TangramEditor saves puzzles to Supabase for official distribution

### THE CRITICAL MISTAKE: Inappropriate Coupling
**What I Did Wrong:**
- Directly imported TangramEditor models (TangramPiece with CGAffineTransform)
- Used editor's internal structures instead of game-specific models
- Created unnecessary dependencies on editor implementation

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- TangramEditor = Developer tool for creating puzzles
- TangramGame = Player game for solving puzzles
- They have DIFFERENT concerns and should NOT share implementation

**The Fix:**
- TangramGame should have its own simplified models
- Only use puzzle DATA from persistence/Supabase
- No dependency on editor's internal types (CGAffineTransform, ConnectionData)

## Important Lessons Learned

### CRITICAL: Always Read the Actual Code First
Before making ANY changes:
1. **Check enum definitions** - Don't assume String rawValues, check if Int with displayName
2. **Check existing types** - Don't create duplicate views/models
3. **Check method visibility** - Private vs public methods in services
4. **Check return types** - Data vs UIImage, etc.
5. **Check property existence** - Don't assume properties exist (like isValid)

### Architecture Principles Violated
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Editor and Game mixed together
2. **Single Responsibility** - Models trying to serve two masters
3. **Dependency Inversion** - Game depending on editor internals

### @Observable Limitations
- Cannot use computed properties that reference other instance properties
- Use stored properties or implicitly unwrapped optionals initialized in init

### Type System Rules
- PuzzleDifficulty: Int rawValue, use .displayName for UI
- PuzzleCategory: String rawValue (already capitalized)
- Always check what ForEach expects (Binding vs non-Binding)

## Refactoring Progress (COMPLETED)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create Game-Specific Models
**Created:**
- `GamePuzzleData` - Simplified puzzle model with just target positions
- `GamePuzzleData.TargetPiece` - Target position/rotation for validation
- `GameProgress` - Progress tracking without editor dependencies

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Fix PuzzleGameState
**Fixed:**
- Removed duplicate PlacedPiece definition (using CV-focused one)
- Fixed optional binding error (placedPieces is not optional)
- Updated to use GamePuzzleData instead of TangramPuzzle

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Update TangramGameViewModel
**Updated:**
- Changed selectedPuzzle to GamePuzzleData
- Fixed restoreGameState to not use optional binding
- Convert TangramPuzzle to GamePuzzleData on selection

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Create New Canvas View
**Created:**
- `GamePuzzleCanvasView` - Simplified canvas without editor dependencies
- `SimplePieceShape` - Basic shape rendering without TangramGeometry
- Removed old PuzzleCanvasView that depended on editor types

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Simplify Data Flow
```
Supabase (TangramPuzzleDTO) 
    ‚Üì
PuzzlePersistenceService (caching/sync)
    ‚Üì
PuzzleLibraryService (for game)
    ‚Üì
TangramGame (gameplay only)
```

The game should ONLY care about:
- Target piece positions for validation
- CV input processing
- Progress tracking
- Completion detection

NOT editor concerns like:
- CGAffineTransform manipulation
- Connection editing
- Piece locking/unlocking
