//
//  PiecePlacementService.swift
//  Bemo
//
//  Service for managing tangram piece placement logic
//

// WHAT: Coordinates piece placement by delegating transform calculations to PieceTransformEngine
// ARCHITECTURE: Service layer in MVVM-S, ensures consistency between preview and placement
// USAGE: Used by ViewModels and Coordinator for piece placement operations
//
// RESPONSIBILITIES:
// - Calculate initial piece placement with connections
// - Find valid snap positions for edge-to-edge connections
// - Delegate all transform calculations to PieceTransformEngine
// - Delegate all overlap detection to PieceTransformEngine
//
// NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR:
// - Transform calculations (use PieceTransformEngine)
// - Overlap detection algorithms (use PieceTransformEngine)
// - Connection validation (use ConnectionService)
// - State management (handled by ViewModel)
