## ⚠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Promotion Not Triggered**
- **Check:** Are ALL puzzles in the difficulty completed?
- **Debug:** Use "Current Promotion Status" in debug view
- **Fix:** Complete missing puzzles or use debug completion buttons

### **Issue: Timer Not Working**
- **Check:** Is auto-advance countdown showing?
- **Debug:** Use "⏱️ Test Timer Integration" button
- **Expected:** Should see 3, 2, 1 second countdown

### **Issue: Views Not Appearing**
- **Check:** Are the new view imports working?
- **Debug:** Check console for any SwiftUI view errors
- **Expected:** Smooth transitions with .opacity and .scale animations

### **Issue: Progress Not Persisting**
- **Check:** Is UserDefaults saving working?
- **Debug:** Use "📊 View Promotion History" to see saved data
- **Expected:** Promotion records persist across app restarts

## 🔄 Development Testing Workflow

### **Rapid Development Testing:**
1. **Use Debug Interface** for quick iteration
2. **Test Individual Components** with mock data first
3. **Validate Real Flow** with actual puzzle completion
4. **Check Edge Cases** (0 puzzles, 1 puzzle, exact completion)

### **Production Testing:**
1. **Fresh User Journey** - New child profile through complete flow
2. **Cross-Session Persistence** - Force quit app, verify state recovery
3. **Performance Testing** - Ensure smooth 60fps transitions
