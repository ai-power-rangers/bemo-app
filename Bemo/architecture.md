Bemo: SwiftUI App Architecture (v2)This document outlines a high-level software architecture for the Bemo iOS app. The design prioritizes modularity, scalability, and testability, using modern SwiftUI principles and incorporating key refinements for a production-ready application.High-Level Architectural Pattern: MVVM-SWe will use a variation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, extended with a Service layer (MVVM-S).Model: The data layer. Simple Swift structs representing your app's data (e.g., User, Game, Level, RecognizedPiece).View: The UI layer (SwiftUI). The views are responsible for presenting the data and capturing user input.ViewModel: The presentation logic layer. It prepares data for the View and handles user actions.Service: The business logic and external dependencies layer. Services handle networking, computer vision, and database access. They are injected into ViewModels via a DependencyContainer.Core App Structure & ModulesThe app is broken down into feature modules to promote separation of concerns.BemoApp (Main)

Detailed Component Breakdown1. Game Engine: A Plug-and-Play ApproachThis is the heart of the play experience, designed to treat each game as a self-contained module.Game Protocol: The contract that every game must follow. It's now responsible for providing its own UI.import SwiftUI

protocol Game {
    var id: String { get }
    var title: String { get }

    // Each game creates and provides its own SwiftUI view.
    // This makes the game engine truly generic.
    func makeGameView(delegate: GameDelegate) -> AnyView

    // Processes input from the CVService.
    func processRecognizedPieces(_ pieces: [RecognizedPiece]) -> PlayerActionOutcome
}
GameDelegate Protocol: The communication channel from the isolated game back to the main app.protocol GameDelegate {
    func gameDidCompleteLevel(xpAwarded: Int)
    func gameDidRequestQuit()
    // Other events like "hint requested", etc.
}
GameHostViewModel: This is the main ViewModel for the game screen.It holds the currently selected Game.It conforms to GameDelegate, listening for events from the game module.It connects the CVService output to the game's processRecognizedPieces method.When it receives gameDidRequestQuit(), it tells the AppCoordinator to navigate back to the lobby.2. Shared ServicesProfileService: A new, crucial service.Responsible for setting, clearing, and providing the currently active child's profile.The GameHostViewModel uses this service to know which profile is earning XP from the GamificationService.3. Data ModelsRecognizedPiece (formerly GameObject): Represents a physical piece recognized by the CVService. Example: RecognizedPiece(shape: .triangle, color: .red).PlayerActionOutcome (formerly GameUpdate): Represents the result of a player's move. Example: an enum with cases like .correctPlacement, .incorrectPlacement, .levelComplete.Refined Data Flow: Placing a Tangram PieceCamera & CV: The CVService captures a frame and recognizes a "red triangle." It creates a RecognizedPiece model.Service to Host VM: The CVService passes the [RecognizedPiece] array to the GameHostViewModel.Host VM to Game Logic: The GameHostViewModel passes the pieces to the active TangramGame instance by calling processRecognizedPieces(...).Game Logic: The TangramGame logic checks if the piece is in the correct position. It determines the outcome is .correctPlacement and returns this PlayerActionOutcome.UI Update: The TangramGame's internal ViewModel updates its own TangramGameView to show a positive visual feedback (e.g., the piece glows). The game is self-contained.Delegate Communication (If needed): If the placement completes the level, the TangramGame's logic calls delegate.gameDidCompleteLevel(xpAwarded: 50).App-Level Reaction: The GameHostViewModel (acting as the delegate) receives this call. It tells the GamificationService to add 50 XP to the current child's profile (which it gets from the ProfileService).This updated architecture makes your system more robust, easier to test, and ready to scale with new games and features.
