# Send Welcome Email Edge Function

This Supabase Edge Function sends a welcome email to new users when their parent profile is created in the database.

## Overview

The function is triggered by a database webhook when a new row is inserted into the `parent_profiles` table. It uses the Resend API to send a beautifully formatted welcome email to the new user.

## Environment Variables

The function requires the following environment variables:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key for sending emails
- `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Supabase service role key for authentication

## Webhook Payload

The function expects a webhook payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "INSERT",
  "table": "parent_profiles",
  "record": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    // ... other fields
  },
  "old_record": null
}
```

## Security

The function validates that incoming requests include the correct service role key in the Authorization header to ensure only authorized webhooks can trigger emails.

## Email Features

- Professional HTML email template with responsive design
- Personalized greeting using the user's name
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Fallback plain text version for email clients that don't support HTML
- Bemo branding and educational messaging

## Testing Locally

1. Start the function locally:
   ```bash
   supabase functions serve send-welcome-email

       "record": {
         "email": "test@example.com",
         "full_name": "Test User"
       }
     }'
   ```
